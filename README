GorgeyShotgunRetribution
=================

* Description:
Allows gorges in Natural Selection 2 to pick up and use shotguns.

The Gorge Kharaa lifeform is a peace loving support class, fighting only when
their home, hive or habitat are in danger. They just want to live a good life
and work to feed their babblers. Too often a gorgey is working on defenses
or supporting an alien push, when a Shotgun-toting marine appears and promptly
ends the poor gorgey's existance. Enough is enough. The time of retribution is
upon us, for the gorges fortunate enough to survive an encounter with a shottie
marine, or chance upon a fallen shotgun, have taken up this powerful weapon and
now seek vengeance against all marines.

Credit for this idea goes to gorgemuffins, an aus ns2 player. The following is
a (paraphrased) quote from a game I played recently.

"lhvwb: Serious question, where do think onos with dual miniguns would fit
into the alien tech tree?
gorgemuffins: Gorges need shotguns first."
